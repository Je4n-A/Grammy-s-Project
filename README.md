A/B Test Analysis: Website Pages Per Session

This project presents a comprehensive A/B test analysis comparing the pages per session of two websites. The goal of the project was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in user engagement between the two sites.

Project Objective

    To analyze data from two websites and determine if their average pages per session differ significantly, using a two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances. The analysis was performed at a 95% confidence level.

Key Features:

    Statistical Analysis: Conducted a two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances to compare means between two independent samples.
    Data interpretation: Interpreted test results, including t-statistics, ùëÉ-values, and critical values, to draw valid conclusions.
    Excel Proficiency: Utilized advanced Excel functions and tools for calculations and analysis.

Statistical Skills

    Hypothesis Testing: Formulated null and alternative hypotheses and evaluated them using a t-test.
    Confidence Intervals: Applied the 95% confidence level criterion to assess the validity of test results.
    Understanding Variances: Analyzed data samples with unequal variances to ensure robust conclusions.

Data Analysis

    Data Preparation: Handled datasets with varying sample sizes (1856 and 484 observations).
    Variance and Mean Calculations: Summarized key metrics such as sample means and variances.
    Significance Testing: Computed and interpreted t-statistics and P-values to determine statistical significance.

Excel Skills

    Statistical Analysis Toolpak: Used Excel's built-in Data Analysis Toolpak to perform the two-sample t-test.

Formulas and Functions

    AVERAGE: Calculated the mean pages per session for each website.
    VAR.S: Determined the variance of the samples.
    COUNT: Verified the number of observations in each sample.
    T.TEST: Cross-verified the t-test results using Excel's formula for direct significance testing.

Results

    The analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the two websites' average pages per session, with an extremely low two-tailed ùëÉP-value (9.9174√ó10^‚àí103). The t-statistic (‚àí27.6195) exceeded the critical t-value (1.9647), further supporting the rejection of the null hypothesis.

Takeaways

    This project highlights the importance of statistical analysis in data-driven decision-making. By combining statistical knowledge with Excel‚Äôs robust analytical capabilities, this project demonstrates proficiency in handling real-world data challenges and providing actionable insights.
